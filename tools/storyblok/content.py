            "In B2B, the price on the shelf is rarely the price a customer pays. Contract pricing is the practice of showing each account the price they negotiated, and it is the foundation of any serious wholesale portal.",
            ("Why list prices fall short", "Most B2B relationships are governed by agreements: a fixed price for a year, a percentage off a category, or a volume break that kicks in at a pallet. When a portal shows only list price, buyers assume the portal is wrong and go back to email. Contract pricing removes that doubt by showing the negotiated number everywhere, from search results to the cart."),

Buyers should never have to guess how many units earn the next price. A small nudge such as add 12 more to save 4 percent turns a pricing rule into a prompt to buy."),
